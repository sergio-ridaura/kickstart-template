## Hello, I am Sergio Ridaura

Since I was a child, I have always been fascinated by computing. At the age of {getEgbAge(5)}, in {getEgbYear(1976, 5)}, I started programming in BASIC on a Philips VG-8020 8-bit MSX.

Throughout my {pastYears(getYear(), 1997)} years of experience, I have worked on developing desktop and web applications across multiple sectors such as healthcare, education, energy, advertising, banking and more.

This experience has led me to become a full-stack JavaScript developer, specializing in high-performance applications and websites. I am always exploring new ways to optimize and improve the user experience in the web browser as an operating system.
